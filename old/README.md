I have lost the passphrase for the backup of 0x3F2660D7EA6FFA91, and I couldn't extend the expiration date. Therefore, I have created new keys and signed its public key with the old one, using expired signing key on YubiKey (used --faked-system-time).\
0xBECD00A3CC0B3C60.asc.sig is signature of 0xBECD00A3CC0B3C60 public key signed by by signing key of 3F2660D7EA6FFA91\
